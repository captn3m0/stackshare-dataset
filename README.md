# stackshare-dataset

A dataset from stackshare.io providing lists of packages and various services. While a list of packages for
various ecosystems is easily available elsewhere, a list of services is much harder.

See `tools.csv` for a complete list. I'd recommend sorting by populatity and using the top 2.5-3k results
depending on your usecase.
